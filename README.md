#### Course Description

One of the most common tasks performed by data scientists and data
analysts are prediction and machine learning. This course will cover the
basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an
emphasis on practical applications. The course will provide basic
grounding in concepts such as training and tests sets, overfitting, and
error rates. The course will also introduce a range of model based and
algorithmic machine learning methods including regression,
classification trees, Naive Bayes, and random forests. The course will
cover the complete process of building prediction functions including
data collection, feature creation, algorithms, and evaluation.
